# Pages should have at least one `<h1>`

## Some things that I am currently:
- a front-end and accessibility focused web developer.
- still fascinated with the power of html and that people can just *make* websites.
- actively trying to build web things that promote equal access to information and services in Government.
- like ~99% sure that whole page zoom (browser zoom) is a sufficient technique to meet SC 1.4.4. Text-only zoom is not required.
- drinking coffee. 

## Some web opinions:
- I like to use github desktop because it's exactly 168,000% easier than git from the command line.
- I like utility-based css, but I see the value in more traditional naming conventions if well-organized.
- Everything should not be a `<div>`.
- Use semantic html elements instead of reinventing things browsers have done natively for you since 1996.
- <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/"> <strong>Eleventy (11ty)</strong> </a> is fantastic and I use it a lot.
- Bring back Netscape Navigator. But seriously everything being built on chromium isn't a great idea.
- I want a text-only or reader-only version of the web please and thank you.

All opinions here are my own, but please leave twitter/X and don't support people who profit from hateful things.
