# Use your brain please

## Decentralize and resist
- quit all major platforms in favor of the fediverse
- even github is not immune, start backing up code in places that are secure and offline. See <a href="https://codeberg.org/"> Codeberg </a> for an EU based git hosting alternative.
- host your own stuff. Servers are awesome actually.
- Can't host your own? Pick a hosting provider in the EU like <a href="https://uberspace.de/"> uberspace </a> or 1984 in Iceland
- pick some battles and drop using services that appear free. You and your actions are the product.
- check on your friends.
- use rss.
- abolish ICE. 

## I am currently:
- unapologetically pro-union. Check out <a href="https://www.techworkersunion-1010.org/"> Tech Workers Union Local 1010 </a>!
- The Chair of a DEIA Accessibility Sub-Committee. Come get me. 
- still fascinated with the power of html and that people can just *make* websites.
- actively trying to build web things that promote equal access to information and services in Government.
- like ~99% sure that whole page zoom (browser zoom) is a sufficient technique to meet SC 1.4.4. Text-only zoom is not required.
- drinking coffee.
- trying to ensure that workplaces are inclusive of a variety of opinions and that work is done in a transparent way.
- restoring a bunch of PowerPC macs

## Opinions that are my own:
- I like to use github desktop because it's exactly 168,000% easier than git from the command line.
- I like simple css with direct naming conventions and the use of utilities.
- You should use real html language codes from the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry"> IANA Language Subtag Registry</a>, not make them up. 
- Use semantic html elements instead of reinventing things browsers have done natively for you since 1996.
- <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/"> <strong>Eleventy (11ty)</strong> </a> is fantastic and I use it a lot.
- Bring back Netscape Navigator. But seriously everything being built on chromium isn't a great idea.
- I want a text-only or reader-only version of the web please and thank you.
