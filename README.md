# Pages should have at least one `<h1>`

## Today I might be using:
- Mid 2005 iBook, 1.5GB RAM, 1.33ghz PPC G4, OSX 10.5.8, with some funny stickers, missing the caps lock key, and an OEM original friggen ~220 month old battery with a million loadcycles that somehow still has 95% capacity left. Literally a tank.
- Early 2001 iBook Dual USB, 512MB RAM, 500mhz PPC G3, OSX 10.4.11, with a broken cd drive and a heat cracked and worn exterior: "patina". 
- Late 2003 iBook, 768MB RAM, 800mhz PPC G3, OS 9.2.2, absolutely immaculate and mint, how?
- some whatever m1 macbook air that's super powerful and has a battery that lasts like a year and weighs one pound but is no fun. 

## I am currently:
- a front-end and accessibility focused web developer.
- unapologetically pro-union. Check out <a href="https://www.techworkersunion-1010.org/"> Tech Workers Union Local 1010 </a>!
- still fascinated with the power of html and that people can just *make* websites.
- actively trying to build web things that promote equal access to information and services in Government.
- like ~99% sure that whole page zoom (browser zoom) is a sufficient technique to meet SC 1.4.4. Text-only zoom is not required.
- drinking coffee.
- trying to ensure that workplaces are inclusive of a variety of opinions and that work is done in a transparent way.
- opting out of any AI tools learning from my work. Good luck AI! ::AI learns sarcasm::
- tinkering with old Macs.

## Opinions that are my own:
- I like to use github desktop because it's exactly 168,000% easier than git from the command line.
- I like simple css with direct naming conventions and the use of utilities. I'm tired of naming things "wrapper" and "container" and "inner_container" so it's ok to use some utility classes.
- You should use real html language codes from the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry"> IANA Language Subtag Registry </a>, not make them up. 
- Use semantic html elements instead of reinventing things browsers have done natively for you since 1996.
- <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/"> <strong>Eleventy (11ty)</strong> </a> is fantastic and I use it a lot.
- Bring back Netscape Navigator. But seriously everything being built on chromium isn't a great idea.
- I want a text-only or reader-only version of the web please and thank you.
