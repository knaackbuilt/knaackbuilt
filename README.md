### Hello ~~world~~ GitHub.

- I'm most often a **front-of-the-front-end** developer. No idea what that means? **[Read this great article by Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)**

- I like the convience and speed of **utility-first css** because I have no idea what class="secondary__components--block-modifier_next-thing2" class that you wrote is either. It's all nonsense just pick what is simplest for the project.

- I've written a ton of traditional css and sass too. It works better sometimes given the constraints of the project or system you are working in.

- html is awesome. css is awesome. javascript is hard.

In the traditional sense, I'm a front-end developer. That means a lot these days so I'll clarify further by saying that if you manage a database, it's not the front-end. If you write everything in python or c++ it's not the front-end. If the only html element you know is `<div>` then you don't work on the front-end. 

Everything has bled into "front-end" to the point that people call themselves front-end developers and then proceed to list 51 backend languages they work with most often.
