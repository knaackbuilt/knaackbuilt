# Working on Building a More Equitable Tech World

I want to build technologies that humans actually find useful. I like solving technical problems in simple and creative ways and prefer to use straighforward HTML, CSS, and JS when possible. I am neurodivergent and do not see the world the way you do: let's talk about what that means so we understand each other. 

## I am currently:
- unapologetically pro-union. Check out <a href="https://www.techworkersunion-1010.org/"> Tech Workers Union Local 1010 </a>!
- still fascinated with the power of html and that people can just *make* websites.
- actively trying to build web things that promote equal access to information and services in Government.
- like ~99% sure that whole page zoom (browser zoom) is a sufficient technique to meet SC 1.4.4. Text-only zoom is not required.
- drinking coffee.
- trying to ensure that workplaces are inclusive of a variety of opinions and that work is done in a transparent way.
- trying to be a good, kind, respectful leader.
- evolve constantly as a technologist.
- getting an Autism diagnosis.

## I commit regularly from:
1. **2020 MacBook Air M1**: (work) An amazing laptop that after almost 5 years I can still work 8 hours on battery and it never slows for a second.
2. **2020 MacBook Air M1**: (personal) Ditto above. Used with a water damaged screen. This computer was practically pennies (considering it can run tier 1 OS in 2025) used and after several attempts at replacing the screen I found one that was partially water damaged for cheap. New screens are double the price of the entire machine. I can now replace an m1 air screen in 15 minutes flat, AMA.
3. **2009 Macbook**: This is ergonomically one of my favorite machines ever. It's the right size and weight for your lap, with a keyboard that feels real and mechanical. OSX 10.10 - everything felt really modern when this OS was new. 
4. **2008 FrankenBook Intel Core 2 Duo**: The screen of a Black 2007 MacBook and the body of a 2008 White MacBook Frankensteined together. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I hadn't really checked in on ubuntu in a while: turns out it's great. This ~18 year old laptop now has the latest release of VSCode. Insane. Linux FTW.
5. **2005 PowerBook G4 17-inch**: amazing behemoth of a laptop. This has my favorite graphics card of all time: ATI Radeon 9700 128MB. Wish I had this computer in 2005. OSX 10.4.11.

## Opinions:
- I like to use github desktop because it's exactly 168,000% easier than git from the command line.
- I like simple css with direct naming conventions and the use of utilities.
- You should use real html language codes from the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry"> IANA Language Subtag Registry</a>, not make them up. 
- Use semantic html elements instead of reinventing things browsers have done natively for you since 1996.
- <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/"> <strong>Eleventy (11ty)</strong> </a> is fantastic and I use it a lot.
- Bring back Netscape Navigator. But seriously everything being built on chromium isn't a great idea.
- I want a text-only or reader-only version of the web please and thank you.
- Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Live it.

## Languages/frameworks/tools/concepts/libraries I regularly work in or have professional familiarity with:
- **The big three core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and Javascript** in all their glory and frustration (lots of expertise and experiences that I'd like to forget like Internet Explorer...)
- WCAG & Accessibility Engineering (lots of expertise!)
- 11ty (static site generator) and Jamstack in general
- Nunjucks & Twig (and by default anything jinja or django inspired or syntax related)
- Dozens of other templating languages including Handlebars, Mustache, HAML, Pug, Liquid, Markdown, etc. 
- Tailwind (controversial, but there are some good uses of utility based css for rapid development and simple, direct work)
- AlpineJS (I use this in place of jQuery - it's much smaller and crazy powerful considering it can be templated directly into the DOM)
- Bootstrap (does anyone build with this anymore? Like 60% of the internet was based on it for a while so I can dive right back into ~2015 any day)
- Svelte (no virtual dom needed!)
- Reluctantly React familiar
- Drupal and other monolithic php based CMS's
- Everything git and github ecosystem related
- AWS, Netlify, and other hosting and cloud providers
- DevOps in general including the entire software development lifecycle (See products I have directed hundreds of code pushes for at ny.gov and governor.ny.gov)
- Technical crisis management and rapid development and problem solving under extreme or unique conditions
- Building and adapting technical tools in creative ways, often needing to learn other languages and methods rapidly to deliver on features
- Python and AI based conceptual coding and framework management (models, local and remote infrastructure for generations). Not a daily driver concept though.
- UNIX, Shell, Bash, various config type scripting and DevOptimization concepts
- Every Macintosh computer built between 2001 and 2009 I can restore and make awesome. What a golden age of computing - sort of
