### Hello ~~world~~ GitHub.

- I'm most often a **front-of-the-front-end** developer. No idea what that means? **[Read this cool article by Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)**

- I like the convience and speed of **utility-first css** because I have no idea what `class="secondary__components--block-modifier_next-thing2"` class that you wrote is either. It's all nonsense just pick what is simplest for the project.

- I've written a ton of traditional css and sass too. It works better sometimes given the constraints of the project or system you are working in.

- Websites aren't that hard. Stop making them hard. 

- Accessibile development is usable development. Build everything with accessibility first!

In the traditional sense, I'm a front-end developer. That means a lot these days so I'll clarify further by saying that if you manage a database, it's not the front-end. If you write everything in python or c++ or php it's not really the front-end. Everything has bled into "front-end" to the point that people call themselves front-end developers and then proceed to list 51 backend languages they work with most often.

I'm pretty good at: ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white) & ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white)

I use stackoverflow for: ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E) & ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)

Templating languages are cool and I work with these a lot: <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/template-nunjucks-brightgreen" alt="nunjucks template language" /> & <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/template-twig-green" alt="twig template language" />
