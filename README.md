# Welcome to my github profile!

## Some things that I am currently:
- a front-end and accessibility focused web developer.
- still fascinated with the power of html and that people can just *make* websites.
- actively trying to build web things that promote equal access to information and services in Government.
- still confused if SC 1.4.4 applies with text-only zoom or page zoom.
- drinking coffee. 

## Some web opinions:
- I like to use github desktop because it's exactly 168,000% easier than git from the command line.
- I like utility-based css, but I see the value in more traditional naming conventions if well-organized.
- Everything should not be a `<div>`.
- <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/"> <strong>Eleventy (11ty)</strong> </a> is fantastic and I use it a lot. 

All opinions here are my own.
